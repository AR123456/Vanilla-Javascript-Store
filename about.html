            Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead singer and pianist Chris Martin and lead guitarist
            Jonny Buckland at University College London. After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman
            joined the group as bassist and they changed their name to Starfish.Will Champion joined as drummer and
            backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is often referred
            to as the fifth member by the band. The band renamed themselves Coldplay in 1998, before recording
            and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers & Sisters and The Blue Room in 1999. The Blue Room was
            their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.
            Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the song "Yellow" in 2000, followed in the same year
            by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush
            of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won awards including NME's Album of the
            Year. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, received mostly positive reviews,
            though some critics felt it was inferior to its predecessor. Their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or
            Death and All His Friends (2008), the best-selling album worldwide of 2008, was produced by Brian Eno and
            released to largely positive reviews, earning three Grammy Awards. In October 2011, Coldplay released their
            fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped the charts in over 34 countries, was the UK's best-selling
            rock album of 2011, and received mixed reviews. In May 2014, they released their sixth album, Ghost
            Stories, which also received mixed reviews and topped several national album charts. In December 2015, the
            band released their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, which reached the top two in most major markets,
            but received generally mixed reviews.
